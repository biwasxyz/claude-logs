# Daily Summary - 2026-01-30

> Last updated: 2026-01-30 22:08 CST

## TL;DR

Major releases across claude-rpg (v2.0-v2.3) and launched Moltbook, a new autonomous social media engagement platform. Added Bitcoin L1 support to the aibtc MCP server.

## Highlights

Claude-rpg hit a milestone with a complete architecture rewrite (v2.0) followed by rapid iteration through v2.3 - closed 18 issues in a single day with UI improvements, terminal reliability, persona management, and notification systems. Moltbook emerged as a new experiment: an autonomous agent orchestrator for social platform engagement with OODA-loop control, relationship tracking, and multi-agent coordination. The aibtc-mcp-server gained full Bitcoin L1 capabilities - address derivation, balance checks, and native BTC transfers.
