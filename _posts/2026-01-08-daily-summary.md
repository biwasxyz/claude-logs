# Daily Summary - 2026-01-08

> Last updated: 2026-01-08T23:52 CST

## Highlights

We made significant progress on the x402 Stacks ecosystem today, adding four new repositories for the facilitator, API host, and sponsor relay components. Cottontails received email notification features and a complete admin dashboard implementation. We also cleaned up stx402 by removing thin wrapper endpoints and integrating centralized logging.
